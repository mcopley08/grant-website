For mother <333333:

so the two things you'd be doing to manage the website is to add grants and add posts.

in all of these instructions, only change values TO THE RIGHT side of the colon (:)

how to add a grant

go to the "index.js" file and go to line 99. it should say something like this:

	var query = { "name": "Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms Program" };

to set the name of the new grant, change the "Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms Program" to whatever you want your new grant
to be called. Remember to enclose the name of the grant in double quotes like above.

Next, we need to update lines 102-108 with information specific to the new grant. 

line 102 (name) this is simply the same name we just placed on line 99.

line 103 (link) you would just change this link to point to your new grant.

line 104 (deadline) you would just change this date to the due date of the new grant. the format is MM-DD-YYYY

line 105 (category) is which of the categories it falls into. this one might be a little tricky, but I've listed 
all of the possibilities below. When picking a category, make sure to always pick one of the values on the 
left hand side. For example, if the category was "Children and Youth" on the website, we see here that 
it corresponds to "children-and-youth". So "children-and-youth" would be the correct value to set the category to:

var categories = {
					"arts-culture-libraries": "Arts, Culture, and Libraries",
					"children-and-youth": "Children and Youth",
					"economic-community-development": "Economic and Community Development",
					"education": "Education",
					"miscellaneous": "General/Miscellaneous",
					"health": "Health",
					"homeland-security": "Homeland Security",
					"housing-homeless": "Housing / Homeless",
					"human-services": "Human Services",
					"justice-crime-prevention": "Justice & Crime Prevention",
					"media-communications": "Media & Communications",
					"natural-resources": "Natural Resources",
					"parks-and-recreation": "Parks and Recreation",
					"technology-research": "Technology & Research",
					"transportation": "Transportation"
				};

so an example of this line might be:

	"category": "transportation"

line 106 (eligibility) ive simply copied this field from your excel spreadsheet into this field, so id keep doign that unless
you wanted to change it a little bit!

line 107 (award) this is simply how much the total sum of the grant. this one SHOULD NOT be enclosed in double-quotes.

line 108 (description) this is just whatever you want to say about the grant to help people learn about it. I've simply copy & pasted this 
field from your google sheets document, as well! :p haha

Once you've changed all of these lines, start the website and visit: http://localhost:8080/update_grant
if it was successful, it will tell you that on the webpage and it will show you the information you've just entered!



**************************************************

to update posts, we need to change a few values. Remember in all of these instructions, 
only change values TO THE RIGHT side of the colon (:). :

change line 127 of "index.js", which should look like: 

	var query = { "name": "Resources for Food Tech Companies" };

and change the "Resources for Food Tech Companies" to whatever you want the post to be named. 
don't forget to include the double quotes!

We'll now need to change lines 130-135 to create our new posts. ive included a breakdown of the lines below:

line 130 (name) this is simply the same name we placed in line 127.

line 131 (date) don't change this value, skip this one!

line 132 (subheader) this is simply a sentence that dscribes the post if you'd like to include it.

line 133 (author) this will be your name, "Lisa Copley"

line 134 (description) this is where all of the text will be placed for your post!

line 135 (links) this is a list of links you can include. the syntax is that whatever is here has to be 
enclosed by brackets, and all of the values are separated by a comma. ill give a few examples below

if you dont have any links:
	"links": []

if you have one link:
	"links": [ "neopets.com" ]

if you have more than one link:
	"links": [ "neopets.com", "pokemon.com", "yugioh.com" ]


Once you've changed all of these lines, start the website and visit: http://localhost:8080/update_post
if it was successful, it will tell you that on the webpage and it will show you the information you've just entered!



******************** starting the website ************************
open "windows powershell", type in "node index.js", and press enter!


as always, definitely let me know if something isn't working and ill be more than happy to help out :)
