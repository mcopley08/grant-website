layout of website:

- we'll have grant data in a sql database
- search will search all grants name's to see if they're a match (we can do a query for all of them and search manually, its less than 1000 strings, not terrible) (or we do a SQL query, preferred)
- have a list of categories that would query the sql database by the name of the category. a "list all" or something equivalent should be available here.
- on the main page where it lists upcoming events, we do a sql query on the upcoming deadlines. it would be a query that takes today's date and makes sure everything else it greater than it.
- USE MONGODB cloud for database, easier, has an online GUI... just use it...
- create a collection for posts ma wants to keep updated with the website.
